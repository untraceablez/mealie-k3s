Your Mealie instance has been deployed!

1.  MetalLB is provisioning an IP address. Get the external IP by running:
    kubectl get svc {{ .Release.Name }}-mealie-svc -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'

2.  Wait a few minutes for the application and database to start, then open the IP address in your browser.

3.  Default login credentials (from Mealie docs):
    Username: changeme@example.com
    Password: MyPassword
